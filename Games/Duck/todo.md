# open todos for duck ecosystem

- create and organize interfaces in a seperate py file, specifically for IObserver, ISubject and IDecorator
- ecosystem needs to be Subject as well and have all objects which cannot be in Pont
- ideally all the different animals/humans at the lake should be from the same class and provide decorator options, e.g. ranger, hunter, duck, wolf
- all these observers should provide an danger factor back to the lake and all animals at the lake should respond to the danger potential at the lake. this then has to be part of the abstract class as getDanger() method
